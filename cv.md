I really want to become a React developer, 
I’ve been learning programming for over a year 
now and managed to work as a freelancer creating websites on the WordPress CMS.

At the moment I have mastered such technologies as:
HTML, CSS, JS, Sass, GULP, Vite, GIT, Figma

Sample code from codewars:
6 kyu
Take a Ten Minutes Walk
```javascript
function isValidWalk(walk) {
  if (walk.length == 10) {
  let n = 0,
      s = 0,
      w = 0,
      e = 0
  for (let char of walk) {
    if (char === 'n') ++n
    if (char === 's') ++s
    if (char === 'w') ++w
    if (char === 'e') ++e
  }
  
   return n - s == 0 && w - e == 0
    
  } else return false
}
```

My pet project Gurmani: https://github.com/Kolxoznek/gurmani
Technologies used: HTML, SCSS, JS, Vite, Json-server, tiny-slider

I studied using free sources and YouTube, as well as the course of Ivan Petrichenko Javascript + React

My English level is A1
